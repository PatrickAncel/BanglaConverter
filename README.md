# Bangla Converter

This program is for those of us who are used to English keyboards to type Bangla characters. It converts keypresses and key combinations into their Bangla equivalents. For example, <kbd>K</kbd> produces "ক", and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> produces the aspirated version: "খ". This tool is still being developed. Come back later for more features and a complete manual.
